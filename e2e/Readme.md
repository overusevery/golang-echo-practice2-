# E2E Testing

E2E focuses on testing communication between components that have been unit-tested individually.

## Overview

The E2E (End-to-End) testing includes:

1. **Standard End-to-End Scenario**

   This scenario ensures that communication between components is tested at least once for each possible component relationship.

2. **Handling Specific Infrastructure/3rd Party Errors**

   If specific errors are generated by infrastructure or third-party services, and our code changes behavior in response to these errors, there's a risk that we might fail to understand and handle these specific errors properly.
